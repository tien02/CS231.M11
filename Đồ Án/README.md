# Human Detection using HOG

In my final project of CS231 class. I'm working on "Human Detection" using HOG feature in order to find out basic model like "Dalal & Triggs Model" and "Deformable Part Model".
Through this final project, I know some basic idea about:
* HOG feature
* Sliding Window
* Image Pyramid
* Concept about "Feature Descriptor"
* Filter
* Cross-Correlation
* Idea of part-based-model 
The powerfull of modern Deep Learning Model may surpass these old model, but after this project, I've learned lots of knowledge about Computer Vision.
